error handling -> used to manage and responde to the runtime errors


javascript provides error handling mechanisms

try -> try block contains the code that may execute, maynot not execute
catch -> block executes when an error occurs in the try block

throw -> throw the user message

finally --> which is going to execute regardless of success or failure


try {
    //code that may give error
} catch(error){
    //code to handle the error
} finally {
    //code that will always execute
}
