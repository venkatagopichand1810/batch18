// State management is used to maintain the state of the application....we are going use useContext hook in functional compoentns to fix the prop drilling problems

// import { createContext } from "react";



// prop drilling -> props to all the nested components which is not good for the larger applications

// useContext -> where are going to create the centralized state or store,,which will fix the prop drilling



//useContext

// const value = useContext(myContext), 
// createContext
