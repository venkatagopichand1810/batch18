for loops.... if we wanted to repeat a block of code for the specific number of times...

for(init; condition; increment/decrement){ 
    the block of code  
}

//init....it will init the loop
//condition: before the increme 
//increment/decrement.. after the condition


while and do while are the loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as spcified condition is true


while loop: The condition is going to check before the code block is executed...

do ..while loop.. the code block is executed at least once before the condition is checked...


while(condition){
    //code to execute
}
the loop runs as long as the condition evalutes to true...
//if the condition is false intially the loop won't run at all
