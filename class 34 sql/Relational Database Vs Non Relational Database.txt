Relational Database Vs Non Relational Database


Relational Database:
Data will be stored in rows and columns in the tables
fixed schema
SQL 
banking, inventory systems
ACID
large data -> slower peformance
oralce, mysql, sqllite



Non Relational Database (mongodb) -> is the document based database
Data will be stored as document structure, key - value pair
flexible in the schema
JSON/BSON (Binary JSON) .....just our normal JSON
{
    name: "venkat",
    address: "bangalore"
}
analytics, IOT, social media, Media and Entertainment
peformance scalable is there

js -> react, angular
