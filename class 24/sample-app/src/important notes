in react we wont see any html file

we are going to write both html and javascript in same file

JSX(javascript xml) is the extension for javascript used in react.

//HTML + JS = jsx
<!-- 
//<script src = ""></script>

//<link rel = "" -->


//inside the return statement we are going to use html code
//before return statement we are going to use javascript



//rules we need to remember when we use jsx

1) when we write more than one line of html code, we must and should have one parent element

2) in jsx while create the component the component name should be capital letter


react is the SPA,, only one PAGE WILL BE LOADED
